## Network Architecture

The network is designed with security and segmentation as core principles. Traffic is segregated into distinct VLANs based on function and security requirements, with the Aruba 2930F switch handling VLAN tagging, trunking, and routing.

### Network Topology Highlights

- **Core switching** provided by Aruba 2930F
- **Multiple wireless networks** through VLAN-tagged SSIDs
- **MAC-based authentication** and access control lists (ACLs) on the Aruba switch
- **Integrated Netgear Orbi system** as dedicated access point (AP mode only)
- **Structured cabling** with patch panel implementation

## VLAN Configuration

| VLAN ID | Name | Subnet | Purpose |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 10 | Management | 10.0.10.0/24 | Network monitoring and management access |
| 20 | Homelab | 10.0.20.0/24 | Self-hosted services with no direct internet exposure |
| 30 | Trusted | 10.0.30.0/24 | Private trusted devices with limited access to VLANs 10 and 20 |
| 40 | IoT | 10.0.40.0/24 | Isolated network for Internet of Things devices |
| 50 | Guest | 10.0.50.0/24 | Internet-only access with client isolation |

### VLAN Security Features

- **Management VLAN 10:** Full access to all VLANs for network monitoring and management; no external device access except for authorized administrators
- **Homelab VLAN 20:** Hosts self-hosted services with no direct internet exposure
- **Trusted VLAN 30:** Access to Management VLAN for administration; blocked from IoT VLAN and Guest VLAN
- **IoT VLAN 40:** Internet access for cloud services; isolated from all other VLANs
- **Guest VLAN 50:** Outbound internet access only with DHCP-assigned addressing; client isolation enabled

## Server Specifications

### Dell PowerEdge R230 Server

**Upgraded Components:**
- **CPU:** Intel Xeon E3-1270 V6 (3.80 GHz, 4C/8T)
- **Memory:** 32GB ECC RAM (2x16GB A-TECH UDIMM, dual-channel optimized in A1 & A2 slots)
- **Storage:**
  - 1TB Vulcan Z QLC SATA SSD
  - Crucial MX500 SATA SSD
- **Cooling:** Kryonaut thermal grease for improved heat dissipation
- **Expansion:** Additional bays available for future storage or RAID configurations

## Virtualization Environment

The primary virtualization platform is Proxmox VE, hosting various virtual machines and containers including:

- **PFSense VM:** Firewall and routing
- **OPNSense VM:** Network security
- **NetData VM:** Performance monitoring
- **Libre NMS:** Network monitoring system
- **OpenVPN:** Secure remote access

### Homelab VLAN (20) Services

Hosted on the Dell PowerEdge R230 within dedicated VMs:
- **Linux VM**
- **Windows VM**
- **OpenMediaVault**
- **Zeek:** Network security monitoring
- **Suricata:** Intrusion detection/prevention
- **PiHole:** Network-wide ad blocking
- **Unbound:** DNS resolver

## Installation Process
