# Windows 10 Installation on Proxmox Hypervisor

This document outlines how I installed **Windows 10 Pro** on a virtual machine using the **Proxmox VE hypervisor**. It includes complete configuration steps, driver setup using VirtIO, and future plans for optimization and feature enhancement. This VM is intended for IT labs, certification prep, and general system administration practice.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Boot the VM from ISO
I started the VM using the mounted Windows 10 ISO.

### 2. Skip Product Key
I clicked **"I donâ€™t have a product key"** during setup.

### 3. Choose Edition
I selected **Windows 10 Pro x64** for full feature support.

### 4. Custom Install
I used **Custom: Install Windows only** to perform a clean installation.

### 5. Load VirtIO Storage Driver
At the disk selection screen, I clicked **Load Driver**, then navigated to:
```
D:\vioscsi\w10\amd64\viostor.inf
```
After selecting the correct driver, the virtual hard drive appeared.

### 6. Complete Installation
I selected the disk and completed the installation as normal.

## Post-Install Network Setup
During setup, Windows did not initially detect the VirtIO NIC. I proceeded with offline setup by clicking **"I donâ€™t have internet"**.

After reaching the desktop:
1. I opened File Explorer and navigated to:
```
D:\NetKVM\w10\amd64
```
2. I right-clicked on `netkvm.inf` and selected **Install**
3. The Ethernet adapter came online successfully

## Optional Enhancements (Planned for Later)
- [ ] Install `virtio-win-guest-tools.exe` to enable balloon drivers, video, and QEMU guest agent
- [ ] Enable QEMU Agent under Proxmox VM > Options
- [ ] Run Windows Updates to patch the system
- [ ] Adjust system scaling and resolution for optimal VM display
- [ ] Take a Proxmox VM snapshot of this clean install state
- [ ] Set up and test RDP connectivity and shared clipboard via QEMU tools
- [ ] Begin documenting hands-on labs such as software troubleshooting and Group Policy configuration

---

## Screenshots (To Be Added)
I will insert step-by-step visuals for the following sections:
- ISO Selection
- BIOS/TPM Configuration
- Storage Driver Load Step
- Network Driver Install Step
- Final Connection Confirmation
